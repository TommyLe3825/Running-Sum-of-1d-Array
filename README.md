# Running Sum of 1d Array

A C++ program that solves the running sum of a vector of integers.

The runningSum method takes a vector of integers as an input and returns a new vector where each element is the sum of all the previous elements in the input vector. The main function creates an instance of the Solution class, calls the runningSum method with a vector of integers, and prints the resulting vector
